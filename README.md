# tagpro-map-editor

This is the source code for the map editor at https://map-editor.tagpro.eu, maintained by Ronding.

This fork of the original editor is independent of node.js; its online components can run on any server with PHP. The interface has some minor improvements, including convenient import/export dropdowns with new features, and support for all map elements.
